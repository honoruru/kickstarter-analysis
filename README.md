# **Kickstarting with Excel**
**Module 1 Challenge**

## **Overview of Project**
The project is an effort to assist Louise in her planning to produce her play.  The project uses Crowdfunding data of productions in multiple genres, medium, and broad topics. The data from an unknown source and is assumed to be reliable.  The analytical tool to be utilized is Microsoft Excel. 
### **Purpose**
The purpose of the project is to assist Louise in planning for a play which she would like to produce.  Specifically, Louise seeks to examine how different campaigns’ launch dates and funding goals might influence their success.  This project seeks to inform Louise on this question. 

##**Analysis and Challenges**
The analysis was performed following techniques and requirements as directed by the Module 1 Challenge. The primary challenge was the uncertainty of whether the analytical steps were to be limited by the exact requirements of Module 1 Challenge; or, if there was an expectation that the writer use techniques learned in Module 1 that went beyond the specified requirements.  As grading points did not appear to be awarded for quality of results, the writer stayed within the specified requirements.  Secondary challenges included correctly developing the tables, pivot tables, and graphs as required.  When not successful, the writer sought solutions using Excel Help and Google searches.  
### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
Data for launch months for all plays, all countries, and all years was analyzed.  The data is depicted graphically below:

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
Data for crowdfunding goals for all plays, all countries, and all years was analyzed.  The data is depicted graphically below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In addition to the challenges mentioned above, the time available to digest the material was impacted by the writer having a full-time job and a family to care for.  This will be overcome with adjustments to daily and weekly routines and finding a rhythm.  Further, being from a much older generation than the instructor, the writer continues to take time to get used to his speed of speaking and intonation.  Both of these challenges are viewed as natural.  The instructor provides multiple channels to receive the materials beyond live instruction which have proven to be helpful. 

## **Results**
### Outcomes based on Launch Date
### *Launch Months Favoring Success*
As illustrated in the graph above, based on Launch Date, the month of May produced the most successful plays, followed in descending order by June, July and August.  February and April produced one less successful play than August.  This would initially suggest the summer months favor success.  However, one notes that the summer months and February have also have the highest number of failed plays.  Looking then at the percentage of success by launch month, one sees that months with the highest success percentage were May and June, with July, February and April tied for third.  August fell slightly behind March, September, and November for percent of success. This observation provides comfort that the early summer months (May through July), February and April appear to be launch months favoring success for plays.  
### *Launch Months Not Favoring Success*
The graph also indicates that plays with December launch month were the least successful.  While November and January launch months had success rates less than the early summer launch months, December was notably worst. 

### Outcomes based on Goals
As illustrated in the graph above, based on Goal, plays with goals up to $14,999, and between $35,000 and $44,999 had better than a 50% success rate.  Of these, the most successful had goals of less than $5,000.  Conversely, plays with goals of $45,000 or greater, had the least chance of success.  

### Limitations of this dataset
As noted, this analysis makes the extraordinary assumption that the data is reasonably complete and accurate, and therefore reliable.  Data on the amount of pledges received and total actual costs of each production would have been useful.  The writer believes that data may be as, if not more, relevant to success than crowdfunding goals and pledges. 

###Other Possible Tables and/or Graphs
If it was known what country Louise’s play would be in, graphs filtered to that country could be informative.  If she has yet to decide, graphs by country might inform her on notable differences of success rates by country.  Additional, if one accepts that the early summer months favor success, a graph of the success rates of those months over the years world indicate whether that has held true over time.
